Apple announced new environmental initiatives today aimed at reducing its carbon footprint by 2030. The company revealed plans to manufacture all future iPhones using 100% recycled aluminum and to eliminate plastic from packaging entirely. In addition, Apple will expand its solar farms in Arizona and Nevada to power more of its data centers with renewable energy. CEO Tim Cook said the effort represents Apple's “most ambitious step yet” toward sustainability. The company also introduced a $200 million fund to help suppliers transition to clean energy and announced that 300 of its major partners have already committed to achieving net-zero emissions within the decade. Environmental groups have praised the announcement but emphasized the need for transparency in verifying progress. Apple stated it will publish an annual environmental report detailing emissions, energy use, and recycling performance starting next year.
