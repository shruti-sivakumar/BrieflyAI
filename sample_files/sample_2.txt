Astronomers at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii have announced the discovery of a new exoplanet, provisionally named HD 101809g, orbiting a red dwarf star nearly 120 light-years away. The planet is classified as a 'super-Earth' due to its size, which is estimated to be approximately 1.5 times the mass of Earth.

Using the advanced high-resolution spectrograph, the research team, led by Dr. Evelyn Reed, detected the planet by observing the minute "wobble" in the red dwarf's movement caused by the planet's gravitational pull. Crucially, HD 101809g appears to reside firmly within the star's habitable zone—the region where temperatures allow for the existence of liquid water on the surface. While the planet is tidally locked (meaning one side always faces the star), Dr. Reed noted that a dense atmosphere could potentially circulate heat, making the region near the terminator (the dividing line between the two sides) a candidate for supporting life.

Further observations using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope are scheduled for the next year to analyze the planet's atmospheric composition, searching for biosignatures like oxygen or methane. This discovery marks a significant step in the ongoing search for life beyond our solar system, offering a new, promising target for detailed study.
